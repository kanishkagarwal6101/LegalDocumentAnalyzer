"because world of warcraft is a `` player vs. player '' game , you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you , rather than contacting blizzard entertainment 's in-game customer service representatives , referred to herein as `` game masters , '' for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race .

"if a character of the same name already exists on the target server , you will be given an opportunity to rename character as part of the character migration process . 
",[]
"as always , the name must adhere to the naming conventions stated herein .

"spotify does not accept any codes of conduct as mandatory in connection with the services provided under these agreements . 
",[]
"where permitted under the applicable law , you and spotify agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action . 
",[]
"unless both you and spotify agree , no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person 's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding . 
",[]
"if you are located in , are based in , have offices in , or do business in a jurisdiction in which this section 24.3 . 
",[]
"is enforceable , the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you : 
",[]
"you and spotify agree that any dispute , claim , or controversy between you and spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these agreements or to your relationship with spotify as a user of the service ( whether based in contract , tort , statute , fraud , misrepresentation , or any other legal theory , and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the agreements ) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration . 
",[7]
"arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court . 
",[]
"there is no judge or jury in arbitration , and court review of an arbitration award is limited . 
",[]
"there may be more limited discovery than in court . 
",[]
"the arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court ( including attorney fees ) , except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration . 
",[]
"this arbitration provision will survive termination of the agreements . 
",[]
"notwithstanding clause ( 24.3.1 ) above , you and spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive , preclude , or otherwise limit either of our rights , at any time , to ( 1 ) bring an individual action in small claims court , ( 2 ) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal , state , or local agencies where such actions are available , ( 3 ) seek injunctive relief in a court of law , or ( 4 ) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims .

"either you or we may start arbitration proceedings . 
",[]
"any arbitration between you and spotify will be finally settled under the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce ( the `` icc '' ) then in force ( the `` icc rules '' ) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the icc rules , as modified by these agreements , and will be administered by the international court of arbitration of the icc . 
",[]
"any arbitration will be conducted in the english language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the european union or any other jurisdiction , the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the state of california , united states , without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles .

"any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one ( 1 ) year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act , omission , or default giving rise to the claim ; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period . 
",[]
"if applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims , any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law . 
",[]
"a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other , by certified mail or federal express ( signature required ) , or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you , by electronic mail ( `` notice '' ) . 
",[]
"spotify 's address for notice is : spotify , attn : general counsel , 45 w. 18th street , 7th floor , new york , new york 10011 , usa .

"the notice must ( 1 ) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute ; and ( 2 ) set forth the specific relief sought ( `` demand '' ) . 
",[]
"we agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly , but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the notice is received , you or spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding . 
",[]
"during the arbitration , the amount of any settlement offer made by you or spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award , if any . 
",[]
"in the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor , spotify shall pay you ( 1 ) the amount awarded by the arbitrator , if any , ( 2 ) the last written settlement amount offered by spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator 's award ; or ( 3 ) $ 1,000.00 , whichever is greater . 
",[]
"all documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator 's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law . 
",[]
"except as required to enforce the arbitrator 's decision and award , neither you nor spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration , including , but not limited to , the fact that the parties are in dispute , the existence of the arbitration , or any decision or award of the arbitrator . 
",[]
"in the event that spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision ( other than a change to spotify 's address for notice ) , you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to spotify 's address for notice , in which case your account with spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision , as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject , shall survive . 
",[]
"if the class action waiver at section 24.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this section 24.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable , then the entirety of this section 24.3 shall be null and void and , in such case , the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in section 24.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the agreements .
