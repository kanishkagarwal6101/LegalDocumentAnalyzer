"( a ) applicability of arbitration agreement . 
",[]
"all disputes arising out of , relating to , or in connection with these terms or your use of the products that can not be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis , except that you and headspace are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights , trademarks , trade names , logos , trade secrets , or patents . 
",[7]
"( b ) arbitration rules . 
",[]
"the federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision . 
",[]
"arbitration will be initiated through the american arbitration association ( `` aaa '' ) . 
",[]
"if the aaa is not available to arbitrate , the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum . 
",[]
"the rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration , except to the extent those rules conflict with these terms . 
",[]
"the aaa consumer arbitration rules ( `` aaa rules '' ) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879 . 
",[]
"the arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator . 
",[]
"if the claim is for $ 10,000 or less , the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted ( 1 ) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator ; ( 2 ) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing ; or ( 3 ) by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules in the county of your billing address . 
",[]
"in the case of an in-person hearing , the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances . 
",[]
"if the parties are unable to agree on a location , the determination will be made by the arbitration institution . 
",[]
"your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the aaa rules with the remainder paid by headspace . 
",[]
"if the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose ( as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11 ( b ) ) , then the payment of all fees will be governed by the aaa rules . 
",[]
"in such case , you agree to reimburse headspace for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the aaa rules . 
",[]
"regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted , the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award , if any , are based . 
",[]
"the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator 's ruling on the merits . 
",[]
"( c ) authority of arbitrator . 
",[]
"the arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities , if any , of you and headspace . 
",[]
"the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties . 
",[]
"the arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute . 
",[]
"the arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law , the arbitral forum 's rules , and the terms . 
",[]
"the arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have . 
",[]
"the award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and headspace . 
",[]
"( d ) jury trial waiver . 
",[]
"you and headspace waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury . 
",[]
"rather , you and headspace elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration . 
",[]
"in any litigation between you and headspace over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award , you and headspace waive all rights to a jury trial , and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge . 
",[]
"( e ) class action waiver . 
",[]
"where permitted under the applicable law , you and headspace agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or consolidated action . 
",[]
"if , however , this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable , neither you nor headspace are entitled to arbitration ; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in section 13.13 below . 
",[]
"you may opt-out of this arbitration agreement . 
",[]
"if you do so , neither you nor headspace can force the other to arbitrate . 
",[]
"to opt-out , you must notify headspace in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement . 
",[]
"your notice must include your name and address , and the email address you used to set up your headspace account ( if you have one ) , and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement .

"( h ) arbitration agreement survival . 
",[]
"this arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with headspace . 
",[]
"to the extent the parties are permitted under these terms to initiate litigation in a court , both you and headspace agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the terms or the use of the products will be litigated exclusively in the united states district court for the central district of california . 
",[6]
"if , however , that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation , then all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the terms or the use of the products will be litigated exclusively in the superior court of california , county of los angeles .
